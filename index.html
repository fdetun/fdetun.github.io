                        <p class="card-text">
                            I am a backend software engineer born and raised in San Jose. I majored in biology and planned on pursuing dentistry but after life circumstances made me a full time caregiver, I grew to appreciate and enjoy programming enough to make the switch. Before
                            the switch, I owe a lot of my development to being a tutor. It made me proud to see the positive change I could make on someone by just magnifying the ability they already had while also growing myself.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I chose to study at Holberton after completing my associates in computer science to build a solid programming foundation and become a better, more well rounded software engineer. My motivation comes from seeing my progress in tangible ways which is one
                            reason I enjoy programming so much. Seeing code speed, cleanliness, documentation, etc. demonstrably improve as I learn and gain experience motivates me to progress more and more. Along with that, I’ve learned from tutoring
                            and my time at Holberton how important and enjoyable exchanging knowledge is. Studying Biology for so long taught me to be humble and never hold on too tightly to my way of thinking. Thats why my favorite projects have been
                            group and partner projects where my ideas grow and improve through collaboration and exposure to different perspectives.
                        </p>

                        <p class="card-text">
                            My interests include music and sports. Unfortunately for both of these, I'm much better at watching others do it than doing it myself. I am always open to talking about all types of music but have soft spots for R&B, soul, neo soul, hip hop, pop, rock,
                            and funk. My favorite sports are hockey, basketball and football but I have been known to watch anything including the oft Youtube recommended professional tag. I love my cat, Hope, and if you were to look through my phone
                            you would probably find an embarassing amount of photos of her. Volunteering is also something I like to do when I have the chance and have done so since middle school.

                        Github OAuth to better handle user security. Developed a functional REST API around this database structure for CRUD manipulation. Deployed on jobodyssey.com and also jobodyssey.hbtn.io with nginx and gunicorn. Planning and development
                        done with a partner utilizing a Kanban board. Holberton School offered a server and database server in order to have this application help organize student job searches.</p>

                        unit tests of storage manipulation in both a JSON text file storage system and ORM database storage system. Jinja2 and JQuery were used to dynamically populate and filter places for rent based on search parameters fed into a REST
